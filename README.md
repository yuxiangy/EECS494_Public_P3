# EECS494_Public_P3

1) up down left right A(rise) S(fall) to control the UFO

2) The UFO control is still a bit weird, but I don’t have time to fix it before due;

3) Cheat:
	
	i)  F1: to destination of level;
	ii) F2: to the planet. Actually only if there is a collision then the scene about planet will be load, but the position may not be chosen carefully since I move the objects several times;
	iii)F3 or F4: To the place where I have put 2 enemies there, but I still need some time to implement them;
	
	1: reload the space scene in the space scene itself or at the end (there is an temporary scene to inform the player’s winning)

4) The screen resolution is 1024 x 768;
